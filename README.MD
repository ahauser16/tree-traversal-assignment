Weâ€™ve supplied you with a **BinaryTreeNode** class, a **TreeNode** class, a constructor for a **BinaryTree** class and a constructor for a more general **Tree** class (this will be an **n-ary** tree).

## **Trees**

Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for **Tree**:

### **sumValues**

Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the sum of all the integers.

### **countEvens**

Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the count of all the even integers.

### **numGreater**

Given a n-ary tree and a number x, find and return the number of nodes which are greater than x.

## **Binary Trees**

Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for **BinaryTree**:

### **minDepth**

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.

### **maxDepth**

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.

### **maxSum**

Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree, but no node can be visited more than once.

### **nextLarger**

Given a binary tree and an integer x, find and return the value of the node with the next larger element in the tree i.e. find a node with value just greater than x. Return null if no node is present with value greater than x.

## **Further Study**

### **areCousins**

Given a binary tree and two nodes, determine whether the two nodes are cousins of each other or not.

### **Serialize / Deserialize Binary Tree**

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Implement both of these methods as statics on the BinaryTree class.

### **lowestCommonAncestor**

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

### **path sum**

### **path sum 2**

### **getElementById**

Implement your own getElementById function.

### **getElementsByTagName**

Implement your own getElementsByTagName function.

### **getElementsByClassName**

Implement your own getElementsByClassName function.
